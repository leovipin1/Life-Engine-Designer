### Make changes

#### Make changes via UI.

First, it is **`not recommended`** to make any changes via the UI. Always use a code editor like **`VS Code`**. If any changes are being made via UI, ensure the commit title follows the **[commit message title convention](#commit-message-title-convention)**.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - **[Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)** will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to **[fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)**.

- Using the command line:
  - **[Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)** so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes

#### Branching convention

Every branch that is created for the development of the program must follow the below guidelines.

1. The branching method for this repository must follow the **`GitHub branch flow strategy`**, where every work done must be created from the **`main`** branch as its base.

2. Before starting work on any issues, a new branch must be created from the **`main`** branch with the naming convention below.

3. **`type/#issueno-title-of-the-issue`** - *This is the branch naming convention, where the **`type`** must be the type of issue for which this branch is being created, **`#issueno`** is the number of the issue that is being worked and **`title-of-the-issue`** is the title of the issue that is being worked on*.

4. Once the work is completed, the work must be committed, and the branch must be published to GitHub by creating a pull request.

5. Once the pull request is merged on GitHub Desktop, move back to the **`main`** branch and pull from GitHub.

6. Once the pull is done into the **`main`** branch, the merged branch must be deleted locally, as the branch on GitHub is automatically deleted after the merge. The below command must be used to delete the merged branch locally.

    **`git branch -vv | grep ': gone]' | grep -v '\*' | awk '{ print $1; }' | xargs -r git branch -d`**

#### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy using the **[commit message title convention](#commit-message-title-convention)**.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request known as a PR.
1.  Fill the **`Pull Request`** template. This template helps users understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.

2.  Don't forget to **[link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)** if you are implementing/solving one.

3. Only merge the pull request once all the status checks are complete, as they manage the labels and project status movement.

#### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! Once your PR is merged, your contribution will be publicly visible.

### Commit message title convention

Every commit message title must follow the below convention.

**`xx:#[##] [issue title]`**

The break up of the convention is as below.

- **`xx:`** - *The beginning of the commit message*.

As we use automatic labelling for pull requests, every commit message must begin with the following.

1. **`ep:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for completing an Epic issue*.

2. **`ft:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for completing a Feature issue*.

3. **`us:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for completing a User Story issue*.

4. **`tk:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for completing a Task issue*.

5. **`bf:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for fixing a bug issue during program development*.

6. **`hf:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for fixing a bug issue during program production*.

7. **`dc:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for completing a Documentation issue*.

8. **`rp:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for updating the Repository structure*.

9. **`ms:`** - *The commit message beginning with this indicates that the commit is for completing a Miscellaneous issue*.

- **`#[##]`** - *The issue number for which this commit is begin done*.

- **`[issue title]`** - *The title of the issue for which this commit is being done*.
